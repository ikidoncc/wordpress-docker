# wordpress-docker
A simple repository.

A simple docker-compose file so you can practice your WordPress skills without having to install many things, just use Docker and Docker compose.

A simple and easy way to run WordPress on any environment, be it Windows, Linux or Mac.

## Requirements:
For everything to work correctly, make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.

Check if docker is installed.
```bash
$ docker --version
Docker version 24.0.7, build afdd53b4e3
```
If you don't have Docker, follow the [documentation link](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)



Check if docker compose is installed.
```bash
$ docker-compose --version
Docker Compose version 2.23.0
```
If you don't have Docker compose, follow the [documentation link](https://docs.docker.com/compose)

## Start containers
Starting containers is quite simple.

### 1 - Run the containers:
```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```
> the -d flag will make containers run in the background.

### 2 - Change the owner of the "/var/www/html" directory inside the container:
```bash
$ docker exec -it wordpress-app chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html
```
> this will give permission to manipulate wordpress without it requesting an ftp connection.

### 3 - Change the owner of the "~/www/wordpress" directory:
```bash
$ sudo chown -R $USER ~/www/wordpress
```
> this will give permission to modify the files generated by the container.
